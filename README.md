## About me 

*I am **Sara Aleassa**, I stadied **Elelctronic Engineering** at YU and I learned a **front-end** languages in Orange lab. Now, I am training at LTUC to be a **UI/UX** designer.*
*I'm interested in psychology, healthcare, and in human energy.*

## What l learned 
*How can I build my mindset to aviod being a victim developer and to make better disicion with programing.<br>
 We must master these key points as a developer:*

***1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software***
 
*The first goal of all developers is helping people. So, we should understand the pourpose of the software to make it useful and easy to use as much as you can.* 

***2. The Goals of Software Design***

*I should make my design able to maintain as easily as possible by developers to ensure the contiunity of my system.*

***3. (Mis)understanding***

*Good developer who is fully understand the systems and tools he work with to avoid any misunderstanding so he will avoid complexity.*

***4. Simplicity***

*Good developer can write simple code to be clear for other programmers not the one who try to show off that he smart by making code copmlex.* 

***5. Complexity***

*When I add complexity to my code I will take more time to do any thing with my code like adding features or fixing bugs. So, I should make it simple and thinke about any changes I want to do and discuss it.*

***6. Maintenance***

*One of my responsibilities as a developer is a maintenance as well as implementation. So, I should think about it.*

***7. Consistency***

*Consistency make the code more simple and easier to understand.*

***8. Prioritizing***

*When I want to make changes in my code, I should choose the one which will bring me a lot of value and requier little effort based on this equation (D=V/E)*
 - *The desirability of a change (D).*
 - *The value of a change (V).*
 - *The effort required to perform the change (E).*
 
 
 ***9. Solving Problems***
 *Steps to solve any problem:*  
  - *Understand it.*
  - *make a plan and take my time to analyze it.*
  - *Divide it into small tasks.*

***10. Good enough is fine***

*I should plan everything from the bedinning. After that I should start write small code and then I will develop it incrementally.*

***11. Predictions***

*I should stop predict to future and trying to solve problem for the future.*

***12. Assumptions***

*I should designed a code based on what I Know when I will start to write a code, not on my assumptions for future.*

***13. Stop Reinventing***

*The only times it’s okay to reinvent the wheel is when any of the following are true:*

- *I need something that doesn’t exist yet.*
- *All of the existing “wheels” are bad technologies or incapable of handling my needs.*
- *The existing “wheels” aren’t being properly maintained.*

***14. Resistance***

*I should say no for any changing requests until I'm convinced that it's required to do it.*

***15. Automation***

*I should automate any thing I can automate it.*

***16. Code measurement***

*It's a wrong way to decide if any code is good or not based code line number.*

***17. Productivity***

*I should increase the productivity of the code by ask my self "How can I remove more code?".*

***18. Testing***

*I should test all part of code before I commit it to source.*

***19. (Under)Estimation***

*I should break the big thing into smaller things befor the estimation. Also, I should add some days to the deadline to avoid missing it.*

***20. Running Away From Rewriting***

*Rewrite the code is not the right choice, I should try to refactoring at the first.*

***21. Documentation and Commenting***

*My comment should contain why I did that, not what I did.*

***22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)***

*I should try to reduce the dependency on external technologies as much as I can.*

 *Her the factors I should consider before I start using some technology:*

- *Is there active development behind it?*
- *Will it continue to be maintained?*
- *How easy is it to switch away from?*
- *What does the community say about it?*

***23. Self-Development***

*I should keep learning in several way.*

***24. Don’t be a hero*** 

*It's okay to be a quitter and dosen't matter if I ask for help.*

***25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help***

*I should think for the solution at the first. Then I should search about it. If I can't solve it then I can ask for a help.*
